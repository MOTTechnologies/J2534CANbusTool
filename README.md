  <a href="https://testerpresent.com.au/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Tester Present -Specialist Automotive Solutions-blue" /></a>    

Windows Forms application to sniff the CANbus with a J2534 tool. I haven't published the code as I was asked not to share the J2534 implementation I am using by the author, so closed source, but free for all. 

## Updates
01/04/2024 Version 1.1 now includes options to select the Baud Rate and Pin Select for HS/MS CAN, and added a hexadecimal to decimal converter tool.

## User Interface
